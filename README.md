# Customer Segmentation Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation by combining RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with clustering techniques such as K-Means. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and target marketing efforts more effectively.

---
## Features
Data preprocessing: Cleans and prepares transactional data.

RFM calculation: Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary features for each customer.

Data transformation: Applies scaling to normalize data.

Clustering: Uses K-Means to segment customers based on RFM scores.

Cluster evaluation: Employs metrics like Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to choose the optimal number of clusters.

Visualization: Provides insightful plots to interpret clusters and customer profiles.

Cluster profiling: Generates summaries of each clusterâ€™s behavior for actionable insights.

---
## Dataset
The model is built and tested on the Superstore Dataset from the Kaggle.

The dataset contains detailed transactional data including invoice date, customer ID, and purchase amount.
