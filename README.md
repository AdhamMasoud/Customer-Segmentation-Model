# Customer Segmentation Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation by combining RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with clustering techniques such as K-Means. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and target marketing efforts more effectively.

---
## Features
Data preprocessing: Cleans and prepares transactional data.

RFM calculation: Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary features for each customer.

Data transformation: Applies scaling to normalize data.

Clustering: Uses K-Means to segment customers based on RFM scores.

Cluster evaluation: Employs metrics like Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to choose the optimal number of clusters.

Visualization: Provides insightful plots to interpret clusters and customer profiles.

Cluster profiling: Generates summaries of each cluster‚Äôs behavior for actionable insights.

---
## Dataset
The model is built and tested on the Superstore Dataset from the Kaggle.

The dataset contains detailed transactional data including invoice date, customer ID, and purchase amount.

## Summary

## 1. Platinum Customers üèÜ

Behavior: Extremely loyal, frequent purchases, and the highest total spend.

Loyalty: Very high ‚Äî short recency, high frequency, high monetary value.

Engagement Strategy:

Exclusive early access to new products.

VIP loyalty programs.

Personalized recommendations and premium support.

## 2. Gold Customers ü•á

Behavior: Regular buyers with good spending habits, but slightly less frequent or lower spend than Platinum.

Loyalty: High ‚Äî moderate recency, good frequency, high monetary value.

Engagement Strategy:

Targeted upselling and cross-selling campaigns.

Seasonal discounts or bundle offers to encourage more frequent purchases.

Invitations to special promotions to encourage transition to Platinum tier.

## 3. Silver Customers ü•à

Behavior: Occasional buyers, moderate spend, may need reactivation campaigns.

Loyalty: Medium ‚Äî longer recency, lower frequency, moderate monetary value.

Engagement Strategy:

Email reminders and personalized discount codes.

Incentives like free shipping to encourage more purchases.

Customer surveys to understand potential barriers to buying
